# Code-Refactor of Horiseon Page

A basic refactoring of existing index.html and style.css files to improve code efficiency. Refactoring the code with semantic html usage resulted in increased accessibility and search engine optimization while maintaining site functionality and display styling. 

## What was accomplished?

- Non semantic html elements were replaced with semantic html elements
- Alt text was added to images
- CSS classes were consolidated 
- A broken navigation tool was fixed
- Comments added to explain changes made
- Meta viewport added to improve search engine optimization
- CSS reorganized to group elements and classes in a logical order


### Installation

To get a working copy on your machine you will need a few things such as access to Gitbash or Terminal, a working SSH key, a Github account, and a code reader like VS Code. 

First:

```
Once you have a working SSH key added to your Github account, go to the Code-Refactor Repository. Click the green "code" button on the top right and clone down the @github.com link with you SSH key.

Next:

```
Open up Gitbash or Terminal and navigate to a directory that you would like to add the cloned repository. Once in your desired directory type in
`code` git clone "Right click to paste your cloned repository" 
```
and press enter. This will clone the repository onto your personal machine.

Lastly:
```
If you type in 'ls' in Gitbash or Terminal you should be shown a list of what is now in your directory. The cloned repository should exist. Simply
'cd' change directory into the new repository and 'code .' to open it with your selected code editor.
```
